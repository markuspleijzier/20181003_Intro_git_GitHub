# Beginners introduction to Git and GitHub

- Date and time: 3rd October 2018, 10:00 - 12:00
- Location: [Drosophila Connectomics Group - Jefferis lab](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/connectomics/), [Department of Zoology](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge, UK
- Please bring your laptop or mobile device if you'd like to follow the practical part



## Overview

**Morning session**:

- [Background and motivation](README.md#background-and-motivation)
- [What is version control? What is Git? What is GitHub?](README.md#what-is-version-control-what-is-git-what-is-github)
- [How can you use Git and GitHub? How can they be useful for you?](README.md#how-can-you-use-git-and-github-how-can-they-be-useful-for-you)
- [Practical session: working with Git and GitHub](README.md#practical-session-working-with-git-and-github)

**Afternoon session**: markdown, pages and wikis; creating good README files; issue tracking; sofware licenses

Being more open and reproducible improves our science:

- Nature Methods 2018 editorial [**Easing the burden of code review**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0137-5):

*An increasing share of modern research relies on analytical code and software. In turn, a good deal of irreproducible research can be attributed to computational tools that are difficult to decipher, use or recreate. Through the concerted efforts of computational researchers and stricter guidelines from publishers, the culture of scientific software is now more open and geared toward dissemination than ever [...]*

- GitHub has become the go-to site when releasing code associated to a manuscript or a project



## What is Git? What is version control? What is GitHub?

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com) is a version control system to keep track and compare the history of changes (*versions*) made to your scripts and files. It is **free** and **open source** and allows you to:
  - Create repositories to host your projects using the [command-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
  - Track changes in the files and folders within your repositories

- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) is a platform to share and showcase your work online with collaborators and the wider audience. A tool to help you build projects that are collaborative, well documented, and version-controlled. It provides:
  - A backup of your repositories
  - A nice visual interface to your repositories
  - A method to collaborate with others

Versions in Git and GitHub are identified by a *revision number*, e.g. 60363b1, also known as *commit*. Each revision is associated with a *timestamp* and the *person* making the change. Revisions can be **compared**, **restored**, and with some types of files, **merged**.

There are other softwares for version control similar to Git, e.g. [svn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion), and also other online platforms similar to GitHub to share and collaborate code, e.g. [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

## Future outlook

- Nature Methods 2018 editorial [**Easing the burden of code review**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0137-5):

*[...] Yet, even in the era of Git repositories, peer reviewing code can be frustrating and time consuming [...] Computational tools are complex objects that depend on many components to run. Dependencies include the operating system, programming language, external code libraries, configuration settings and run parameters. Reproducing these conditions is made even harder by the fact that components typically exist in multiple versions. Many come with their own prerequisites, creating a maddening rabbit hole of dependencies on dependencies [...]*

Two tools that begin to make a difference in the area of code reproducibility and will be the aim of future workshops:

- [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/)
- [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)
